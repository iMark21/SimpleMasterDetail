The user must enter a text in the text input in order to the submit button to work. If text is empty, clicking the submit button must show a simple alert. If the text is not empty, the second screen must be shown.

The second screen must show the text entered in the text input within a label at the top. At the bottom of the screen the current time must be shown in the format dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS. The date must update in a < 1 second frequency (so we can see the current date including the milliseconds).
